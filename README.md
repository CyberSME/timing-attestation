Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/timing-attestation

This site will store the proof of concept implementation for Checkmate, a timing-based attestation system. We call it timing-based attestation, rather than software-based attestation, since ours was the first actual implementation of a system that used hardware-based timing as well as software-based timing.

This repository also hosts the self-checking code only for the derived implementation, "BIOS Chronomancy". Note that because this system was integrated with a real commercial Dell E6400 BIOS, we cannot post a full working system, and the provided code is meant only to show the self-checking algorithm used for the paper's results.

The installation videos are available on the InstallationConfigurationVideos page.
