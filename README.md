# timing-attestation
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/timing-attestation

This site will store the proof of concept implementation for Checkmate, a timing-based attestation system.

It also now hosts the self-checking code only for the derived implementation, "BIOS Chronomancy". Note that because this system was integrated with a real commercial Dell E6400 BIOS, we cannot post a full working system, and the provided code is meant only to show the self-checking algorithm used for the paper's results.

The installation videos are available on the InstallationConfigurationVideos page.

If you would like to read the paper describing Checkmate, it is available here: http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_papers/2011/11_4921/
